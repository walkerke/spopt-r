Description: Spatial optimization algorithms for regionalization, facility
    location, and market analysis. Includes algorithms for spatial clustering
    (Max-P, AZP, SKATER, SPENC, Ward), optimal facility siting (P-Median,
    P-Center, MCLP, LSCP, CFLP, P-Dispersion, FRLM), and market share analysis
    (Huff model). Supports network-based travel times via custom cost matrices.
    Uses a Rust backend via 'extendr' for performance and the 'HiGHS' solver
    for mixed-integer programming.
