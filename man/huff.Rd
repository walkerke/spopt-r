\arguments{
\item{demand}{An sf object representing demand points or areas. Can be
customer locations, census block groups, grid cells, etc.}

\item{stores}{An sf object representing store/facility locations.}

\item{attractiveness_col}{Character vector. Column name(s) in \code{stores}
containing attractiveness values (e.g., square footage, parking spaces).
Multiple columns can be specified for composite attractiveness.}

\item{attractiveness_exponent}{Numeric vector. Exponent(s) for attractiveness
(default 1). Must be same length as \code{attractiveness_col} or length 1
(recycled). Higher values increase the importance of that variable.}

\item{distance_exponent}{Numeric. Distance decay exponent (default -1.5).

Should be negative; more negative = faster decay with distance.}

\item{sales_potential_col}{Optional character. Column name in \code{demand}
containing sales potential values (e.g., disposable income, population).
If NULL, each demand point is weighted equally.}

\item{cost_matrix}{Optional. Pre-computed distance/cost matrix (demand x stores).
If NULL, Euclidean distance is computed from geometries.}

\item{distance_metric}{Distance metric if cost_matrix is NULL:
"euclidean" (default) or "manhattan".}
}
\value{
A list with:
\itemize{
\item \verb{$demand}: Original demand sf with added columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{.primary_store}: ID of highest-probability store
\item \code{.entropy}: Competition measure (higher = more competition)
\item \verb{.prob_<store_id>}: Probability columns for each store
}
\item \verb{$stores}: Original stores sf with added columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{.market_share}: Proportion of total market captured
\item \code{.expected_sales}: Expected sales (sum of prob × potential)
}
\item \verb{$probability_matrix}: Full probability matrix (n_demand × n_stores)
}
Metadata in "spopt" attribute includes parameters used.

\description{
Computes probability surfaces to predict market share and sales potential
based on distance decay and store attractiveness. The Huff model is widely
used in retail site selection to estimate the probability that a consumer
at a given location will choose a particular store.
}
\details{
The Huff model calculates the probability that a consumer at location i
will choose store j using:

\deqn{P_{ij} = \frac{A_j \times D_{ij}^\beta}{\sum_k A_k \times D_{ik}^\beta}}

Where:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{A_j} is the composite attractiveness of store j
\item \eqn{D_{ij}} is the distance from i to j
\item \eqn{\beta} is the distance decay exponent (default -1.5)
}

When multiple attractiveness variables are specified, the composite
attractiveness is computed as:

\deqn{A_j = \prod_m V_{jm}^{\alpha_m}}

Where \eqn{V_{jm}} is the value of attractiveness variable m for store j,
and \eqn{\alpha_m} is the corresponding exponent.

The distance exponent is typically negative because probability decreases
with distance. Common values range from -1 to -3.

\section{Outputs}{

\strong{Market Share}: The weighted average probability across all demand points,
representing the proportion of total market potential captured by each store.

\strong{Expected Sales}: The sum of (probability × sales_potential) for each store,
representing the expected sales volume.

\strong{Entropy}: A measure of local competition. Higher entropy indicates more
competitive areas where multiple stores have similar probabilities.
