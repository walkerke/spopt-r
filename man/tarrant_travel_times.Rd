\title{Tarrant County Travel Time Matrix Example Data}
\format{
A list with four elements:
\describe{
\item{tracts}{An sf object with Census tract polygons including GEOID,
NAME, population, and geometry columns.}
\item{demand}{An sf object with tract centroid points (demand locations)
in WGS84 coordinates.}
\item{candidates}{An sf object with 30 randomly sampled candidate
facility locations in WGS84 coordinates.}
\item{matrix}{A numeric matrix of driving travel times in minutes.
Rows correspond to demand points, columns to candidate facilities.
Unreachable pairs are set to Inf.}
}
}
\source{
Census tract data from the American Community Survey via tidycensus.
Road network from OpenStreetMap via GeoFabrik.
Travel times computed with r5r.
}
\usage{
tarrant_travel_times
}
\description{
A dataset containing Census tract polygons, candidate facility points,
and a pre-computed driving travel-time matrix for Tarrant County, Texas.
Used for demonstrating facility location algorithms with real travel times.
}
\details{
The travel-time matrix was generated using r5r with OpenStreetMap road
network data clipped to Tarrant County. Candidate facilities were sampled
using \code{set.seed(1983)} for reproducibility.
