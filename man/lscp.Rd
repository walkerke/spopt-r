\title{Location Set Covering Problem (LSCP)}
\usage{
lscp(
  demand,
  facilities,
  service_radius,
  cost_matrix = NULL,
  distance_metric = "euclidean",
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{demand}{An sf object representing demand points (or polygons, using centroids).}

\item{facilities}{An sf object representing candidate facility locations.}

\item{service_radius}{Numeric. Maximum distance for a facility to cover a demand point.}

\item{cost_matrix}{Optional. Pre-computed distance matrix (demand x facilities).
If NULL, computed from geometries.}

\item{distance_metric}{Distance metric: "euclidean" (default) or "manhattan".}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Print solver progress.}
}
\value{
A list with two sf objects:
\itemize{
\item \verb{$demand}: Original demand sf with \code{.covered} column (logical)
\item \verb{$facilities}: Original facilities sf with \code{.selected} column (logical)
}
Metadata is stored in the "spopt" attribute.
}
\description{
Solves the Location Set Covering Problem: find the minimum number of
facilities needed to cover all demand points within a given service radius.
}
\details{
The LSCP minimizes the number of facilities required to ensure that every
demand point is within the service radius of at least one facility. This is
a mandatory coverage model where full coverage is required.

The integer programming formulation is:
\deqn{\min \sum_j y_j}
Subject to:
\deqn{\sum_j a_{ij} y_j \geq 1 \quad \forall i}
\deqn{y_j \in \{0,1\}}

Where \eqn{y_j = 1} if facility j is selected, and \eqn{a_{ij} = 1} if
facility j can cover demand point i (distance \eqn{\leq} service radius).
}
\section{Use Cases}{

LSCP is appropriate when complete coverage is mandatory:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Emergency services}: Fire stations, ambulance depots, or hospitals
where every resident must be reachable within a response time standard
\item \strong{Public services}: Schools, polling places, or post offices where
universal access is required by law or policy
\item \strong{Infrastructure}: Cell towers or utility substations where gaps
in coverage are unacceptable
\item \strong{Retail/logistics}: Warehouse locations to ensure all customers
can receive same-day or next-day delivery
}

For situations where complete coverage is not required or not feasible
within budget constraints, consider \code{\link[=mclp]{mclp()}} instead.

\examples{
\dontrun{
library(sf)

# Create demand and facility points
demand <- st_as_sf(data.frame(x = runif(50), y = runif(50)), coords = c("x", "y"))
facilities <- st_as_sf(data.frame(x = runif(10), y = runif(10)), coords = c("x", "y"))

# Find minimum facilities to cover all demand within 0.3 units
result <- lscp(demand, facilities, service_radius = 0.3)

# View selected facilities
result$facilities[result$facilities$.selected, ]
