\title{spopt: Spatial Optimization for Regionalization, Facility Location, and Market Analysis}
\description{
\if{html}{\figure{logo.png}{options: style='float: right' alt='logo' width='120'}}

Spatial optimization algorithms for regionalization, facility location, and market analysis. Includes algorithms for spatial clustering (Max-P, AZP, SKATER, SPENC, Ward), optimal facility siting (P-Median, P-Center, MCLP, LSCP, CFLP, P-Dispersion, FRLM), and market share analysis (Huff model). Supports network-based travel times via custom cost matrices. Uses a Rust backend via 'extendr' for performance and the 'HiGHS' solver for mixed-integer programming.
