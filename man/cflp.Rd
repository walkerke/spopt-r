\usage{
cflp(
  demand,
  facilities,
  n_facilities,
  weight_col,
  capacity_col,
  facility_cost_col = NULL,
  cost_matrix = NULL,
  distance_metric = "euclidean",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{demand}{An sf object representing demand points.}

\item{facilities}{An sf object representing candidate facility locations.}

\item{n_facilities}{Integer. Number of facilities to locate. Set to 0 if
using \code{facility_cost_col} to determine optimal number.}

\item{weight_col}{Character. Column name in \code{demand} containing demand weights
(e.g., population, customers, volume).}

\item{capacity_col}{Character. Column name in \code{facilities} containing capacity
of each facility.}

\item{facility_cost_col}{Optional character. Column name in \code{facilities}
containing fixed cost to open each facility. If provided and \code{n_facilities = 0},
the solver determines the optimal number of facilities to minimize total cost.}

\item{cost_matrix}{Optional. Pre-computed distance/cost matrix (demand x facilities).}

\item{distance_metric}{Distance metric: "euclidean" (default) or "manhattan".}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Print solver progress.}
}
\value{
A list with two sf objects:
\itemize{
\item \verb{$demand}: Original demand sf with \code{.facility} column (primary assignment)
and \code{.split} column (TRUE if demand is split across facilities)
\item \verb{$facilities}: Original facilities sf with \code{.selected}, \code{.n_assigned},
and \code{.utilization} columns
}
Metadata is stored in the "spopt" attribute, including:
\itemize{
\item \code{objective}: Total cost (transportation + facility costs if applicable)
\item \code{mean_distance}: Mean weighted distance
\item \code{n_split_demand}: Number of demand points split across facilities
\item \code{allocation_matrix}: Full allocation matrix (n_demand x n_facilities)
}
}
\description{
Solves the Capacitated Facility Location Problem: minimize total weighted
distance from demand points to facilities, subject to capacity constraints
at each facility. Unlike standard p-median, facilities have limited capacity
and demand may need to be split across multiple facilities.
}
\details{
The CFLP extends the p-median problem by adding capacity constraints. Each
facility \eqn{j} has a maximum capacity \eqn{Q_j}, and the total demand
assigned to it cannot exceed this capacity.

When demand exceeds available capacity at the nearest facility, the solver
may split demand across multiple facilities. The \code{.split} column indicates
which demand points have been split, and the \code{allocation_matrix} in metadata
shows the exact fractions.

Two modes of operation:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Fixed number}: Set \code{n_facilities} to select exactly that many facilities
\item \strong{Cost-based}: Set \code{n_facilities = 0} and provide \code{facility_cost_col} to
let the solver determine the optimal number based on fixed + variable costs
}

# Facilities with varying capacities
