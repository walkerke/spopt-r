\usage{
p_median(
  demand,
  facilities,
  n_facilities,
  weight_col,
  cost_matrix = NULL,
  distance_metric = "euclidean",
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{demand}{An sf object representing demand points.}

\item{facilities}{An sf object representing candidate facility locations.}

\item{n_facilities}{Integer. Number of facilities to locate (p).}

\item{weight_col}{Character. Column name in \code{demand} containing demand weights.}

\item{cost_matrix}{Optional. Pre-computed distance matrix.}

\item{distance_metric}{Distance metric: "euclidean" (default) or "manhattan".}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Print solver progress.}
}
\value{
A list with two sf objects:

\itemize{
\item \verb{$demand}: Original demand sf with \code{.facility} column (assigned facility)
\item \verb{$facilities}: Original facilities sf with \code{.selected} and \code{.n_assigned} columns
}
Metadata is stored in the "spopt" attribute.

\description{
Solves the P-Median problem: minimize total weighted distance from demand
points to their assigned facilities by locating exactly p facilities.
This is an efficiency-focused objective that minimizes overall travel burden.
}
\details{
The p-median problem minimizes the total weighted distance (or travel cost)
between demand points and their nearest assigned facility. It is the most
widely used location model for efficiency-oriented facility siting.

The integer programming formulation is:
\deqn{\min \sum_i \sum_j w_i d_{ij} x_{ij}}
Subject to:
\deqn{\sum_j y_j = p}
\deqn{\sum_j x_{ij} = 1 \quad \forall i}
\deqn{x_{ij} \leq y_j \quad \forall i,j}
\deqn{x_{ij}, y_j \in \{0,1\}}

Where \eqn{w_i} is the demand weight at location i, \eqn{d_{ij}} is the
distance from demand i to facility j, \eqn{x_{ij} = 1} if demand i is
assigned to facility j, and \eqn{y_j = 1} if facility j is selected.
}
\section{Use Cases}{

P-median is appropriate when minimizing total travel cost or distance:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Public facilities}: Schools, libraries, or community centers where
the goal is to minimize total student/patron travel
\item \strong{Warehouses and distribution}: Locating distribution centers to
minimize total shipping costs to customers
\item \strong{Healthcare}: Positioning clinics to minimize aggregate patient
travel time across a population
\item \strong{Service depots}: Locating maintenance facilities to minimize
total technician travel to service calls
}

For equity-focused objectives where no demand point should be too far,
consider \code{\link[=p_center]{p_center()}} instead.

\examples{
\dontrun{
library(sf)

demand <- st_as_sf(data.frame(
  x = runif(100), y = runif(100), population = rpois(100, 500)
), coords = c("x", "y"))
facilities <- st_as_sf(data.frame(x = runif(20), y = runif(20)), coords = c("x", "y"))

# Locate 5 facilities minimizing total weighted distance
result <- p_median(demand, facilities, n_facilities = 5, weight_col = "population")

# Mean distance to assigned facility
attr(result, "spopt")$mean_distance
