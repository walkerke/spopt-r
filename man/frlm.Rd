\usage{
frlm(
  flows,
  candidates,
  network = NULL,
  vehicle_range,
  n_facilities,
  method = c("greedy"),
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{flows}{A data frame or sf object containing flow information with columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{origin}: Origin identifier
\item \code{destination}: Destination identifier
\item \code{volume}: Flow volume (e.g., number of trips)
}}

\item{candidates}{An sf object with candidate facility locations (points).}

\item{network}{Optional. A distance matrix between candidates. If NULL
(default), Euclidean distances are computed from candidate geometries.
For network distances, compute externally using packages like r5r or
dodgr and pass the resulting matrix here.}

\item{vehicle_range}{Numeric. Maximum vehicle range (same units as network distances).}

\item{n_facilities}{Integer. Number of facilities to place.}

\item{method}{Character. Optimization method: "greedy" (default and currently only option).}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Print progress messages.}
}
\value{
A list with class "spopt_frlm" containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{facilities}: The candidates sf object with a \code{.selected} column
\item \code{selected_indices}: 1-based indices of selected facilities
\item \code{coverage}: Coverage statistics
}
Metadata is stored in the "spopt" attribute.

\description{
Solves the Flow Refueling Location Model to optimally place refueling
facilities along network paths. This model maximizes the volume of
origin-destination flows that can be served given vehicle range constraints.
}
\details{
The Flow Refueling Location Model (Kuby & Lim, 2005) addresses the problem
of locating refueling stations for range-limited vehicles (e.g., electric
vehicles, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles) along travel paths.

A flow (origin-destination path) is "covered" if a vehicle can complete
the \strong{round trip} with refueling stops at the selected facilities. The model
assumes:
\itemize{
\item Vehicles start at the origin with \strong{half a tank} (can travel R/2)
\item At each open station, vehicles refuel to full (can travel R)
\item The round trip must be completable without running out of fuel
}

For a flow to be covered, three conditions must be met:
\enumerate{
\item First open station must be within R/2 from origin (half-tank start)
\item Each subsequent open station must be within R of the previous
\item Last open station must be within R/2 of destination (to allow return)
}

This implementation uses a greedy heuristic that iteratively selects the
facility providing the greatest marginal increase in covered flow volume.

\section{Input Format}{

For simple cases, you can provide:
\itemize{
\item \code{flows}: Data frame with origin, destination, volume
\item \code{candidates}: sf points for potential facility locations
\item \code{network}: Pre-computed distance matrix (optional)
}
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Simple example with distance matrix
library(sf)

# Create candidate locations
candidates <- st_as_sf(data.frame(
  id = 1:10,
  x = runif(10, 0, 100),
  y = runif(10, 0, 100)
), coords = c("x", "y"))

# Create flows (using candidate indices as origins/destinations)
flows <- data.frame(
  origin = c(1, 1, 3, 5),
  destination = c(8, 10, 7, 9),
  volume = c(100, 200, 150, 300)
)

# Solve with vehicle range of 50 units
result <- frlm(flows, candidates, vehicle_range = 50, n_facilities = 3)

# View selected facilities
result$facilities[result$facilities$.selected, ]
}
